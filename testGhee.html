    <h2>What is Ghee?</h2>
    <p>Ghee is a clarified butter that has been cooked until the milk solids have been removed. It is a staple in Indian cuisine and has been used for centuries for its nutritional benefits and rich flavor.</p>
    <p>Ghee is made by slowly heating butter until it separates into three layers: liquid ghee, milk solids, and water. The milk solids are skimmed off, leaving behind pure ghee.</p>
    <p>Ghee has a higher smoke point than regular butter, making it ideal for cooking at high temperatures. It is also rich in essential fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants.</p>
